			      quickfix-reflector


==============================================================================
1. Usage

In the quickfix window, simply edit any entry you like. Once you save the
quickfix buffer, your changes will be made in the actual file an entry points
to.

You can also delete lines in the quickfix window. This way, you can first
review the quickfix list, remove all entries you don't care to change, and
then use `%s/foo/bar` (or anything else) on the rest.


2. Technical details

* Works in location list windows, too
* The quickfix buffer is now 'modifiable'
* The usual write commands can be used (`:w`, `:x` etc.), but they won't save
  the buffer to a file. Instead they will trigger replacement for any changes
  you made.
* If you specifically want to save the quickfix buffer to a file,
  you can still do that the same way as before `:write my_qf_list`
* Adding and removing lines in the quickfix buffer breaks each line's link to
  Vim's internal quickfix entry. After making such changes, you need to write
  the quickfix buffer. This will rewrite Vim's internal quickfix list.
  Otherwise, pressing `<Enter>` may jump to the wrong entry.
* If you like to use `:caddexpr` or similar partial updates to the quickfix
  list, you need re-initialize the quickfix buffer before it can be saved. The
  easiest way is to `:copen` again. See issue #25.


3. Limits to text replacement			*quickfix-reflector-error*

Whenever a replacement fails, you get an '[ERROR]' in the corresponding
quickfix entry.

Replacement only works if the text that was modified actually exists in the
corresponding text file and line number. So it may fail if the file was
modified since the quickfix list was built.

If the quickfix entry contains only part of a line, replacement should work as
long as there is a substring of that line with at least three characters.
  Example: The quickfix entry
      `Missing ; at: xyz`
    can be used to replace in a line
      `a = xyz`
    However, it cannot be used in a line
      `xyz = 1+xyz`
    because it is not clear which xyz would need to be replaced


4. Options

                                                              *g:qf_modifiable*
If 1, automatically sets quickfix buffers 'modifiable'. If you prefer to do
this manually, set the value to 0. Default: 1. Example: >
  let g:qf_modifiable = 1
<

                                                              *g:qf_join_changes*
If 1, changes within a single buffer will be joined using |:undojoin|, allowing
them to be undone as a unit.  Default: 0. Example: >
  let g:qf_join_changes = 1
<

                                                              *g:qf_write_changes*
If 1, writing the quickfix buffer will also write corresponding files. If 0,
buffers of corresponding files will be changed but not written, allowing you
to preview the changes before writing the individual buffers yourself.
Default: 1. Example: >
  let g:qf_write_changes = 1
<


5. Events

Custom events can be used like this: >
  autocmd User <event> :echo 'do something'
<
If you prefer, you can redirect a custom event using regular Vim events.
Example: >
  autocmd User QfReplacementBufWritePost doautocmd BufWritePost
<
                                                   *QfReplacementBufWritePost*
This event is sent after making a replacement and writing the corresponding
buffer.
